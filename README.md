## Hi there 👋





- 🔭 I’m currently working on a Computer programming course at leeds beckett university as a beginner programmer I am really enjoying it as it is testing my skills and encouraging me to go above and beyond with my studies to overcome these challenges.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning studying Cyber Security and Digital forensics and unfortunately programming is not my favourite module at all.
- 📫 How to reach me: M.Jaiteh3593@student.leedsbeckett.ac.uk
